    b) Celsius to Fahrenheit 
    
    c) Feet to meters 
    
    d) Yards to meters 
    
    e) Exit program 

Each conversion option should be implemented in a separate function. Your main program must keep on prompting the user to select the conversion function of their choice until the user enters a sentinel value (e) to exit the program.


4.	Write a modular Python program to check whether a given number is a strong number or not. You must implement and use a function called factorial() which takes a number as an input and returns its factorial.



# **Lab 8:**

1.	Write a function called check_disarium() that return if the given number is a Disarium or not. Use this function in your main program. The program keeps on asking the user to enter a new number until the user enters a valid disarium number.


2.	Write a function called custom_print() which will work the same as the print() built-in function.

    •	It should allow variable length arguments
    
    •	It should also accept two keyword arguments: sep and end
    
    •	The default values of sep and end should be the same as the default values of the sep and end of the print() built-in function
    
    •	You cannot directly pass the variable length arguments to the print function. It has to be manually printed one by one using the for loop


3.	Create a function called show_difference(), that takes length and width of square and returns difference of the areas of circle and ellipse. Use this function in your main program to get the length and width of the square and show the result to the user. You should create one general function inside the show_difference() to calculate the area of circle and ellipse.


4.	Create a function next_prime() that takes an integer and returns next prime number. Create an inner function called is_prime() to check if the number is prime or not. Use the next_prime()  in your main program to continuously get numbers from the user until the user enters any string value, which will terminate the program.



# **Lab 9:**

1.	Write an interactive calculator that allows the user to type in mathematical expressions. The program should evaluate the entered expression and print the results. The program should allow the user to keep on performing the calculation unless one of the following two conditions satisfies:
    
    a.	The program crashes due to an incorrect expression
    
    b.	The user enters Quit as a sentinel value. The sentinel value is Quit, not “Quit”


2.	Create a module that contains area calculation functions of three shapes (triangle, circle, and rectangle). Utilize this module in your main program that continuously prompts the user to enter a shape type and depending on the user input it should return the accurate area calculation results. Next, you need to create a function within your main program that calculates the surface area of a cylinder. The cylinder should also be one of the shapes the user can input to get the area.


3.	Write a modular program that gets numbers from the user until they enter “X”. All numbers should be stored in a list. Then a menu should be shown to the user from where the user can request the following information to be produced based on a selection:

    a.	Enter the list of numbers again

    b.	Maximum and minimum numbers in the list 

    c.	Sum of the squares of each number in the list 

    d.	Sort the list in ascending order 

    e.	Exit the program



# **Lab 10:**

1.	Write a modular program that asks the user how many numbers they want to enter. 

    a.	Show the user which numbers were entered multiple time and how many times.

    b.	Number with the highest frequency should be displayed first and so on.

    c.	Remove the duplicates from the list and show the resultant list to the user


2.	Write a modular program that sorts the rows of a given matrix in descending order based on the sum of its items in rows. A sample matrix is shown below:

 ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76608263/149868564-08b1f939-7fa0-44ff-be52-9abeb10f36ff.png)

Each sub-list is considered as a row.  Your modular program should be able to sort a matrix of any dimension. The matrix should be entered by the user directly in the format shown above.



# **Lab 11:**

1.	Write a modular program that asks the user how many points he/she wants to enter. After that, the program should get each point one by one in the form of tuple. All the points should be saved in a list. Calculate the total distance from the first point to the last point.


2.	Write a modular program that allows the user to encrypt or decrypt an entered text. A menu should be shown to the user from where he/she can select to encrypt, decrypt, or exit the program

    a.	To encrypt the text, the following rules should be followed. These rules do not need to be entered manually. You have to save them in a dictionary in your code and use           them.

        a → i

        e → o

        i → u

        o → a

        u → e	b → m

        d → t

        g → b

        m → d

        t → g	1 → 5

        3 → 7

        5 → 9

        7 → 1

        9 → 3

    b.	After encryption or decryption, show the frequency of only the applied rules. Even if the rule is used once, you have to show it. The rules which are not applied should         not be shown. Show the frequencies based on the ascending order of the applied rule.



# **Lab 12:**
	
1. Write a modular program that provides the following functionality to the user:

    •	Read file: get the name of the file from the user to programmatically reads its content. The name of the currently read file should be shown above the menu

    •	Show statistics: display number of sentences and words present in the file

    •	Search and Export: get a string from the user which should contain space-separated terms.Search how many times each term has appeared in the file. Sort the results in an         ascending order based on the term frequency. Display the results on the screen and also write them to a separate file with proper formatting.


2.	Write a modular program that evaluates the strength of a user-entered password and stores it into a file only if the password strength exceeds 8. The program should return a score to tell the end-user how secure their password is based on the criteria given below. Show an appropriate message if the password strength does not exceed 8.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76608263/149870010-f0826098-3fe3-434e-9d10-29d300f345c9.png)


3.	Write a program that gets two natural numbers from the user and calculates the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of those two numbers.    



# **Assignment 02:**

1.	Write a program where the user tries to guess the number the computer has randomly chosen from 1 to 1000 (including both 1 and 1000). The player tries to guess the number in as few attempts as possible. Each time the player enters a guess, the computer tells him\her whether the guess is too high, too low, high, low, slightly high, slightly low, or correct. Once the player guesses the number, the game is over. Use the following conditions to determine how high or low the number is. 

    •	Too high	Guessed number is more than 200 numbers ahead
    
    •	High		Guessed number is more than 10 numbers ahead
    
    •	Slightly high	Guessed number is less than or equal to 10 numbers ahead
    
    •	Correct		Guessed number is exactly the same
    
    •	Slightly low	Guessed number is less than or equal to 10 numbers behind
    
    •	Low		Guessed number is more than 10 numbers behind
    
    •	Too low		Guessed number is more than 200 numbers behind


2.	Write a program that performs various calculations on two numbers based on the selection of the user. Initially, both the number should have None value. If the user tries to perform any mathematical operation when either of the numbers is None, then the program should inform the user that he/she should enter new numbers, which will prompt the user to enter two numbers individually. Once there are numbers available, the user can perform different mathematical operations on them. Selecting any mathematical operation will only show the result of that operation on the two numbers using an appropriate message. The program should keep on running until the user selects the option x. You should create functions for each mathematical operation which will return the result to the main program.


3.	Write a program that gets a number from the user and generates the pattern shown below.

# **Assignment 03:**

Write a modular program that gets a natural number from a user and generates the largest and smallest possible numbers using the digits of the number entered by the user. You must use all the digits and the same digits should be used.

**Features/Restrictions:**

•	You cannot use any type of collection (list, tuple, set, dictionary)

•	Built-in functions of collection cannot be used, including append(), clear(), copy(), count(), extend(), index(), insert(), pop(), remove(), reverse(), and sort()

•	You cannot use max() and min() functions. Besides these, you are free to use any built-in functions. However, those students who will develop their own logic will get higher marks than those who perform the same task using built-in functions

•	There are grades for the modularity, documentation, clarity, and quality of the code



# **Assignment 04:**

Write a modular program that estimates the number of boxes of tiles needed to cover the floor of different rooms. Get the number of rooms from the user. After that, get the name, width, and length of each room from the user. The width and length will be considered in feet. Finally, get the size of a tile in square feet. Next, calculate and show how many tiles will be required for each room. Tell the total number of tiles needed for all the rooms and how many boxes of tiles will be required for all the rooms when each box contains 25 tiles. Furthermore, tell how many tiles will be left unused from the last box if the whole box will not be used. 

**Features/Restrictions:**

•	All the data related to the rooms should be saved in a list of lists. Each room will be represented by one list in the main list, and it will contain room name, width, length, and number of required tiles (in this order)

•	Your solution should have at least a function called tiles_in_room() that will take the size of a tile, width, and length of a room and return the number of tiles it will take to cover the floor of that room

•	The number of tiles should be rounded up to the nearest whole number

•	There are grades for the modularity, documentation, clarity, and quality of the code



# **Assignment 05:**

Write a modular program that allows you to manage a cricket tournament. You should show a menu to the user from where he\she can perform al least the following tasks: 

•	Get team details: ask the user to enter the number of teams participating in the tournament (for simplicity, only allow even number of teams) and get the details of each team. The details should be saved in a list of dictionaries, where each team is represented by a dictionary. For each team you should get at least the name of the team, the number of matches it has played before, number of matches won, and lost. You can get any additional details if you want to enhance the assignment on your own

•	Generate and show a schedule for the tournament by randomly deciding which team should play against which team. For each match, identify the chance of winning for both the teams based on their past won and lost match records. An example of how to calculate the winning chance of two teams is given below:
  
    Winning Rate (WR) = (Won / (Won + Lost)) x 100
    Winning Chance (WC) of Team 1 = (WR of Team 1 / (WR of Team 1 + WR of Team 2)) x 100

•	Show the schedule of the matches in such a way that it is clear, understandable, and appealing

•	Enter the results of the current round: the program should ask the user to enter the result of each match of this round one by one. Based on the entered information, the data of won and lost should be updated in the teams’ details list. A new schedule should be generated using only the teams who have won their matches



# **Assignment 06:**

Develop a modular student course registration system. You should show a menu to the user from where he\she can perform al least the following tasks: 

•	Register New Student: get name, CMS id, and password of a new student (there is no need to get a confirmation password). Encrypt the password using the encrypt function you generated in Lab 11. The functions generated in lab 11 shoud be in a separate file and accessed as a module in this program. Create a dictionary using the new student’s data which should contain “name”, “cms_id”, and “encrypted_password” keys. Save the data of the new student to a file named “students.txt”. If the file does not exist then it should be created and new student’s data should be stored in it. If the file already exists then new data should be added at the end of the existing students records. Each student’s record should be stored on a separate line in the “students.txt” file

•	Show Registered Students: Show the list of all the students who are registered in the system (all students available in the “students.txt” file). You should show only student names and their cms ids

•	Student Login: allow student to enter the system by providing his/her cms id and password. The password should be validated against the data stored in the “students.txt” flie. After logging in, the following menus should be shown In addition to the main menu.
  
  o	Change Name: allow student to change the name stored in the “students.txt” file
  
  o	Delete Account: allows user to delete the account. Before deleting the account from the “students.txt” file, there should be a confirmation message which should ask the         student if they really want to delete their account. If the student agrees, then the record should be removed from the “students.txt” file
  
  o	Logout: log out the current logged in user

•	Exit program
